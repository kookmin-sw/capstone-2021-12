PassedThreshold.unstableThreshold=According the threshold mode, if the total number (or the percent) of passed tests is lower than this threshold then a build is \
                         considered as unstable. Leave this field empty if the unstable state of the build \
                         should not depend on the total number of passed tests.

PassedThreshold.failureThreshold=If the total number of passed is lower then this threshold then a build is \
